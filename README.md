Windows Server Automation with PowerShell 7.1 Cookbook, Fourth Edition, Published by Packt

## About the book
With a foreword from PowerShell creator Jeffrey Snover, this heavily updated edition is designed to help you learn how to use PowerShell 7.1 effectively and manage the core roles, features, and services of Windows Server 2022/2019 in an enterprise setting. Brand new to this edition are recipes exploring the .NET Framework, enterprise server security, and managing Windows Server with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

This latest edition equips you with over 100 recipes you’ll need in day-to-day work, covering a wide range of fundamental and more advanced use cases. We look at how to install and configure PowerShell 7.1, along with useful new features and optimizations, and how the PowerShell compatibility solution bridges the gap to older versions of PowerShell. Topics include using PowerShell to manage networking and DHCP in Windows Server, objects in Active Directory, Hyper-V, and Azure. Debugging is crucial, so the book shows you how to use some powerful tools to diagnose and resolve issues with Windows Server.
